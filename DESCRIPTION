Description: Extends the functionality of R serialization by augmenting
    the built-in reference hook system. This enhanced implementation
    allows an integrated single-pass operation that combines R
    serialization with third-party serialization methods. Facilitates the
    serialization of even complex R objects, which contain non-system
    reference objects, such as those accessed via external pointers, to
    enable their use in parallel and distributed computing.
